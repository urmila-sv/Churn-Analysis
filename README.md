Telecom Customer Churn Analysis Project
Abstract
This project aims to analyze customer churn in the context of a telecom service-based company. The primary objective is to identify the key factors that contribute to customer churn and create a predictive model to anticipate churn events. 
The analysis involves several stages, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation. The dataset encompasses various customer attributes, such as
demographic information, usage patterns, service plans, billing details, and complaints. By employing techniques like logistic regression, decision trees, or gradient boosting, predictive models are constructed and assessed using metrics
like accuracy and precision. The project's findings provide valuable insights for implementing proactive retention strategies, ultimately reducing churn and enhancing overall business performance.

Introduction
Customer churn presents a significant challenge for telecom companies, necessitating a deep understanding of the underlying factors and the implementation of effective retention strategies.This project focuses 
on conducting a customer churn analysis for a telecom company by leveraging a comprehensive dataset. The objective is to identify the key factors that contribute to churn and develop a predictive model. Through 
the utilization of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering techniques, this project aims to uncover meaningful patterns and correlations associated with churn. By employing predictive 
modeling techniques such as logistic regression or decision trees, the developed modelwill enable the company to proactively anticipate churn and implement retention strategies to enhance business performance and customer satisfaction.

Materials and Methods:

The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of customer churn for a telecom company. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon of customers discontinuing their services and switching to a competitor or terminating their subscriptions. This poses a significant challenge for telecom companies as it directly impacts their revenue and market share. 
The main problem to be addressed is to identify the key factors and patterns that contribute to customer churn in the telecom industry. By understanding the underlying causes of churn, the telecom company aims to develop effective strategies to mitigate churn and retain customers. This will involve the implementation of targeted retention initiatives and efforts to enhance customer satisfaction, ultimately improving the company's business performance. 
By completing this project, the telecom company will gain valuable insights into customer churn behavior and be able to take proactive measures to retain customers. By reducing churn rates and improving customer retention, the company can enhance its competitive position, maximize revenue, and foster long-term customer loyalty.

Results and Descriptions:
Our analysis of customer attrition in the telecom industry dataset using Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression models resulted in insightful insights. After finishing data cleaning and preparation, we split the dataset into training and testing sets. Using telecom datasets, the models were subsequently trained and evaluated.                                                                                                                                                             The accuracy of the Random Forest model was 78% on the testing set, whereas XGBoost performed slightly better, with an accuracy of 81%. Logistic regression yielded a 77% accuracy rate. In order to assess the performance of the models more thoroughly, we looked into precision, recall, and F1-score. In these metrics, XGBoost outperformed the rival models, proving to have a stronger ability to reliably identify both churned and non-churned customers. This demonstrates that XGBoost may be the best model for predicting customer attrition in the telecom sector dataset.
By graphically portraying the results, we created graphs to aid in the interpretation of the data. For instance, we used bar charts to compare the accuracy of each model, with XGBoost showing the best accuracy. Line graphs displaying the precision, recall, and F1 score of each model were also provided, allowing for a full understanding of its performance. Overall, our analysis revealed that XGBoost outperformed the other two models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These findings provide the telecom industry with useful data for predicting and minimizing customer turnover, which can help businesses take proactive measures to keep their customers.
